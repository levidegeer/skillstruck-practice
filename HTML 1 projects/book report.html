        <p>The Cat in the Hat is a book where an eccentric stranger (who's a cat!) visits  two children, Sally and Sam, who are home alone and having a very dull day. Their mother is out, and when the Cat comes in, he reassures the kids that their mother won't mind him or his tricks!</p>
        <p>The Cat in the Hat was a box office failure. Fans of the book were offended about how many adult jokes were in the first film. Audrey Geisel banned all future live-action adaptations of her late husband's work after expressing distaste for the film.</p>
